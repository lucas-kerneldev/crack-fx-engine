About the Firefox Test Engineering team
=======================================

The Firefox Test Engineering team oversees the test automation, infrastructure, and manual testing for all of Firefox's services, sites, and apps that are external to the core browsers (and in some cases within the browsers as well).
Our mission is to provide testing and tools to positively impact the quality of Mozilla websites and services.

How to Talk to Us
-----------------

There are a few channels of communication for our group:

- The #fx-test channel on `irc.mozilla.org <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_.
- The `firefox-test-engineering@mozilla.com Google Group/mailing list
  <https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/firefox-test-engineering>`_.
- More details about our team can be found on the `Firefox Test Engineering page on QMO`_.

If you ever have a question, regardless of how difficult it is, you can share
it on those channels and someone should help you out. *Don't be afraid to ask
questions!* You're trying to help us, so it's only fair that we try to help you
in return.

Find a Mentor!
--------------

It's also a good idea to find someone to mentor you as a new contributor.
Having someone you can personally ask for help from is incredibly helpful in
finding your way around.

If you're a new employee, your mentor may be your manager, or it may be a
coworker. If you're a volunteer, ask someone who works on the project you want
to contribute to; if they cannot mentor you themselves, they should be able
to direct you to someone who can.
