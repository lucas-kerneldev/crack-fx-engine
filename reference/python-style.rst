Python Style Guide
==================

This document is a brief set of guidelines for writing Python code at
Mozilla. Individual projects may override these rules; make sure you
know the standards for your project!

General Guidelines
------------------
- Follow `PEP 8`_.
- Check your code against a linting tool. flake8_ is highly recommended for
  this.

Import Statements
-----------------

We expand on `PEP 8`_'s suggestions for import statements. These greatly improve
one's ability to ascertain what is and isn't available in a given file.

Import one module per import statement::

    import os
    import sys

not::

    import os, sys

Separate imports into groups with a line of whitespace: standard library;
(if a web app) Django or other framework; third-party; and local imports::

    import os
    import sys

    from django.conf import settings

    import pyquery

    from myapp import models, views


Alphabetize your imports; it will make your code easier to scan. See how
terrible this is::

    import cows
    import kittens
    import bears

A simple sort::

    import bears
    import cows
    import kittens

Imports on top, ``from`` imports below::

    import x
    import y
    import z
    from bears import pandas
    from xylophone import bar
    from zoos import lions

That's loads easier to read than::

    from bears import pandas
    import x
    from xylophone import bar
    import y
    import z
    from zoos import lions


Lastly, when importing things into your namespace from a package use an
alphabetized ``CONSTANT``, ``Class``, ``var`` order::

    from models import DATE, TIME, Dog, Kitteh, upload_pets


If possible though, it may be easier to import the entire package, especially
for methods as it help answers the question, "where did ``you`` come from?"

Bad::

    from foo import you


    def my_code():
        you()  # wait, is this defined in this file?


Good::

    import foo


    def my_code():
        foo.you()  # oh you...

Whitespace matters
------------------

* Use 4 spaces, not 2---it increases legibility considerably.
* Never use tabs---history has shown that we cannot handle them.

Use single quotes unless double (or triple) quotes would be an improvement::

    'this is good'

    'this\'s bad'

    "this's good"

    "this is inconsistent, but ok"

    """this's sometimes "necessary"."""

    '''nobody really does this'''

To continue a new line use a ``()`` not ``\``.

Indenting code should be done in one of two ways: a hanging indent, or 4-space
indent on the next line.

Good, using hanging indent. Note that the next line is lined up with the
previous line delimiter::

    log.msg('Something long log message and some vars: {0}, {1}'
            .format(variable_a, variable_b))

Good using 4 spaces::

    accounts = PaymentAccounts.objects.filter(
        accounts__provider__type=2,
        something_else=True
    )

    # A more compact alternative.
    accounts = PaymentAccounts.objects.filter(
        accounts__provider__type=2, something_else=True)

    accounts = (PaymentAccounts.objects
        .filter(accounts__provider__type=2)
        .exclude(something_else=False)
    )

Remember that comprehensibility is the goal here. If following one of the rules
above would result in less readable code, don't follow it!
