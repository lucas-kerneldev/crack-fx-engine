IRC Bot
=======

We have a chat bot in our IRC channel providing useful features such as
notifications or new issues, pull requests and pushes to our GitHub
repositories.

The `source code`__ is available on GitHub, and notifications can be configured
for any repository by following `the steps in the documentation`__.
